LEVEL06

- There is a "level06.php" script and a "level06" executable in the home directory.
- We look into the php script.
"cat level06.php"

- The script does some replacements within its functions, reads first two arguments, calls function x with these arguments and prints it. It turns out that the important point is that the x funtion uses "/e" modifier, which makes the code vulnerable to a command injection.

- We can use a regular expression to execute the getflag command within the x variable, which will then display the flag in an "Undefined variable" error message:
"echo '[x ${`getflag`}]' > tmp/myflag"
"./level06 /tmp/myflag"
