LEVEL04

-There is a "level04.pl" pearl script in the home directory
- When we print it, we see that it expects to receive parameters from a http request. 
- There is a hint in the comment that port 4747 can be used.
- The script gets the value of parameter x from the web request, which is then passed to the function 'x' and printed.
- The script has a command injection vulnerability, as we can directly include input in the shell command.
- We can sent following request when the web server is running locally on port 4747:
"curl http://localhost:4747/?=`/bin/getflag/`"

- We made a http request via curl with specified URL, and passed the getflag command as the parameter.
This way, we can directly obtain the flag.
