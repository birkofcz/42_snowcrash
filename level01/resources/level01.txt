LEVEL01

- We look around through directories, starting from the root. "ls -la" shows that "dev", "etc" and other directories were modifiedi n 2024, as opposed to others. We look for "flag01" in these directories first.

- We go to the "etc" directory and look for "flag01" (recursive search starting from the current directory)
"grep -r "flag01" ."

- Output displays a passwd directory for username "flag01". 
"./passwd:flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw:3001:3001:: /home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash"

- "42hDRfypTqqnw" is not the password, so we still have to crack the string. The snow crash video guy mentions that we will need John the Ripper for password cracking.
"echo "flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw" > decode.txt
"john --format=descrypt decode.txt"
"john --show decode.txt"

- Output is the right password to get flag01:
"flag01:abcdefg"
