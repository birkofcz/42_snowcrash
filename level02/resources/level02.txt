LEVEL02

- There is a "level02.pcap" file in home directory. Pcap files are data files containing the packet data of network. We want to look inside the package, and use Wireshark for that purpose.

- We look inside the packets and find out that packet no. 43 contains the string "Password: ". We analyze the flow of data for this packet (follow TCP stream), and its contents as Hex Dump.

- This allows us to see that the password is
