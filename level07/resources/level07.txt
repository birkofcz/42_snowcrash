LEVEL07

- There is a "level07" executable in the home directory. Executing it will print "level07" string.
- We can use ghidra to look into function calls made by the program, so we launch ghidra, open level07 in it and decompile the main function.

- The decompilation log shows that getenv is called with the LOGNAME environment variable, which gets printed..
- Running the env command will confirm that the LOGNAME is set to "level07".
- We can set it to execute the "getflag" command instead:
"export LOGNAME=\`getflag\`"

- the "\" escape characters enable us to save the backticks as well, which will execute the getflag command upon running the executable:
"./level07"
