LEVEL03

- There is a "level03" executable in the home directory. We want to analyze the binary using a reverse-engineering tool called ghidra.

- When we look into the main function using ghidra, we see:
"system("/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me"

- A system call is made to execute the echo command, using /usr/bin/env
- The usr/bin/env command searches the PATH env variables to locate the echo executable.
- PATH contains directories which we can control such as "tmp", so we can manipulate it.

- We create a script that mimics echo command, but executes the "getflag" command instead
"nano /tmp/echo"
"#!/bin/bash
/bin/getflag"

- We make this new script executable
"chmod +x /tmp/echo"

- We put the "/tmp" prefix to the PATH env variable, so that it will be the first directory to be searched for executables.
- Running the executable will now trigger the getflag command and give us the flag:
"./level03"
